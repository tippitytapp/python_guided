## Conceptualize
-----------------

What are graphs used for in everyday life?
    - Maps
    - Social Networks
    - Railways
    - Video Games
    - Designing and Planning

Graphs use nodes or vertexes and edges to connect each nodes

Cyclic Graph -- you can continue traversing over and over and over
To be cyclic, if theres anyway to start at a node and traverse back to it in anyway, the whole graph is cyclic
Acyclic Graph -- you cannot

Bonus: Dijjkstra's Algorithm, A* ("A star")


Graph Representations
----------------------

* Adjacency Matrix
            TO
         A   B   C
F    A   F   T   T
R
O    B   T   F   T
M
     C   F   F   F


* Adjacency List (We'll use this)

edges = {
    'A': [B, C],
    'B': [B, A, C],  # order doesn't matter
    'C': []
}

A neighbor is a node that is immediately connected to another node
