# Data Structures
# Why are they importan and why do we study them?

# Types of Data Structures
    # Arrays / Lists
    # Dictionaries / Objects
    # Classes / Create Your Own

# Runtime Complexity
    # A way to measure efficiency 

    # "constant"
        # Constant Run Time
            # Takes a constant amount of ime to run
        # Examples:
            # Accessessing an element in an array/list by its index
                # list[0]
                # list.append(x)

    # "linear"
        # Linear Run Time
            # Depends on the size of the input
            # Amount of time it takes to run a the operation scales linearly with the input size
        # Examples:
            # def sum(data):
            #     total = 0
            #     for d in data:
            #         total += d
            #     return total

    # "quadratic"
